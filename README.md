# Module 1: Horiseon Code Refactor 

## Description 

For this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the codebase of a fictional marketing agency's website. Horiseon essentially wanted the codebase to adhere to web accessibility standards for prime optimization as a search engine.

There are several motives behind this project. It marks the introduction to HTML and CSS and allows one to understand how to simplify the redundancies in an existing codebase. The main objective of this challenge is to refactor the existing codebase by removing excess code and meet the web accessibility standards for users. 

The following image displays the web application's updated appearance and functionality:
